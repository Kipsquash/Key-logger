This is a python script that logs the keys typed  by the user 
in a text file. It uses the pynput library to listen for keyboard events 

This script is not intended for malicious use. It is intended for my personal educational only.

The Script works by listening for  keyboard events, and when a
 key is pressed, it logs the keys to a text file in order to keep track of it.


         CURRENTLY NOT WORKING
